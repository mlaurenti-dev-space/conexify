# Conexify

This repository currently contains only a README and a `.gitignore` file. No source code has been committed yet. The project appears to be set up for development in a Visual Studio environment based on the contents of `.gitignore`.

Once implementation begins, this README should be expanded to describe the goals, functionality, and usage of the project.
